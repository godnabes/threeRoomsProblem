# threeRoomsProblem
Question E from the OCC CODE CUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximation of the problem: 

  Make a program that allows a user to input the height, width and exact perimeter
  made up from three rooms that fit exactly into the height and width of the building,
  using only integers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes from myself:

  I believe this program works for all cases but there's probably a very easy way to do this, 
  however this is my approach to the problem.
