# threeRoomsProblem
Question E from the OCC CODE CUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximation of the problem:
Make a program that determines if its possible to input the height, width and exact perimeter
which is made up from three rooms that fit exactly into the height and width of the building,
using only integers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes from myself:
I believe this program works for all cases but there's most likely a very easy way to do this, 
however this is one approach to the problem.
